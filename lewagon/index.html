		<h1>Who are we?</h1>

		<h2>1. Overview</h2>
		<p>High school can be pretty daunting! Especially when you have to balance your academics with all the different tasks required of you for college admissions!

		Weâ€™re here to make your final high school years a little less stressful! As recent graduates with placements at some of the best universities in the world (ESSEC Business School, Princeton, UC Berkeley, UCLA, UCL, Imperial, HKU. UToronto, Parsons) and gotten top-most scores on our IB Diploma, we know all about presenting our best selves to colleges and acing the IB, and can help you do the same. 
		<br>
		<br>

		Now that we have a birds-eye view of high school, we want to make sure you know things we wish someone told us before we began IB, and university applications.

		<br>
		<br>

		Covid-19 has given us all an extended summer vacation, so make the most of this break by building your portfolio, picking up on academics, and starting your uni applications - all with our help! </p>
